# SQL-POS
This POS system is a combination of hardware and software that is used to perform sales transactions with customers. It quickens and defines the entire process, from inventory management to payment processing. When customers reach the cashier, their items are scanned using a barcode scanner that is linked to the inventory system. POS systems are useful for more than just computing total pricing. It applies discounts and taxes where applicable. It also manages customer loyalty programs. The POS system is designed to identify members by scanning their PC optimum cards. Each member's card is linked to their PC Optimum account, which stores their points and purchase history. When a member's card is scanned, the system automatically applies any applicable members-only discounts or promotions. It also updates the points based on the purchase value. Members may accumulate points over time and redeem them in the future. The POS machines allow customers to pay with cash, credit/debit cards or gift cards. After accepting payment, the system generates a receipt, updates the inventory in real-time, and records the transaction.

The system is designed to incorporate a wide range of functionalities, including but not limited to the point system, inventory management, and membership details. Each of these components will handle and display relevant data that will dynamically update based on various processes and interactions. It is crucial to outline the distinct roles and their corresponding capabilities within the system. First, the cashier will have access to a comprehensive suite of features. Using the scanner, the cashier can efficiently process transactions by scanning items, monitoring and managing the inventory, tracking points accumulated by customers, and accessing detailed information about memberships and their statuses. This functionality enables cashiers to perform their duties effectively, ensuring smooth operations at the point of sale. On the other hand, customers will interact with the system differently. They will be able to view the prices of their items and check their accumulated points. Additionally, customers can redeem discounts based on the number of points they have earned. However, unlike cashiers, customers will not have access to the inventory details. This restriction ensures that customers can only view information pertinent to their transactions and rewards, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of inventory data. Overall, the system is designed to cater to the specific needs of both cashiers and customers, enhancing operational efficiency and improving the user experience.
